       <ol>
           <li><strong>Marinate the Chicken:</strong>In a mixing bowl, combine the chicken pieces with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, red chili powder, turmeric, and salt.
            Mix well to ensure the chicken pieces are evenly coated.
            Cover the bowl and let the chicken marinate for at least 30 minutes in the refrigerator.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Prepare the Sauce:</strong>Heat oil or ghee in a large skillet or pan over medium heat.

            <br>
           <li><strong>Add Spices:</strong>Stir in the tomato puree, cumin powder, coriander powder, garam masala, and fenugreek leaves.
            Cook the mixture until it thickens and the oil starts to separate from the spices.</li> 
           <br>
            <li><strong>Cook the Chicken:</strong>Add the marinated chicken to the sauce and cook until the chicken is no longer pink in the center.
                You can add a little water if the sauce gets too thick.</li>
           <br>
            <li><strong>Finish the Dish:</strong>Stir in cream and simmer for a few more minutes until the sauce reaches your desired consistency.
